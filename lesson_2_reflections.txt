What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

 - .git folder is created, thus repository structure is prepared
 - repository is without any commits - "initial commit state"
 - no files are tracked
 
 How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
 - is temporary place to prepare commitment batch

 git diff -rozdíl mezi working directory a staging area
 git diff --staged - rizdíl mezi staging area a nejaktualnejsim commitem
 git diff id1 id2 - rozdil mezi 2 commity
