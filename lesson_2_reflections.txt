What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

 - .git folder is created, thus repository structure is prepared
 - repository is without any commits - "initial commit state"
 - no files are tracked
 
 How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
 - is temporary place to prepare commitment batch

 git diff -rozdíl mezi working directory a staging area
 git diff --staged - rizdíl mezi staging area a nejaktualnejsim commitem
 git diff id1 id2 - rozdil mezi 2 commity


How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

  - test differences between working directory, staging area and repository

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

 - could be useful to test new features, when I don't want to mess up master branch
 - or to mark up some stable versions (production ready)


 branching:
 
 git branch   -seznam branchu (a ktery je aktualni)
 git branch branch_name     -vytvoreni branche z aktualniho umisteni
 git checkout branch_name   - checkout do zvoleneho branche
